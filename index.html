        <div class="about merriweather">

            <p>Latti is an American hip hop artist and producer. Hailing from Dallas, Texas he hit the underground music scene in the early millennium. He performed at local venues and had several singles on local radio stations. In 2008 he started an Independent record label and focused mainly on production as well as artist development. He produced songs featuring artists such as Bizzy Bone, Lil Flip, Spice 1, Mr. Pookie, Mr. Lucci, and more. In 2012 Latti shut his label down and started recording his first solo album. Using a combination of haunting melodies and a savage flow Latti created a truly unique and powerful sound. However, his efforts were halted in 2014 when his mother, his biggest supporter and inspiration for doing music, was diagnosed with terminal ovarian cancer. He became her sole caretaker till she passed away in 2017. Determined to get his solo career back on track and dedicate his success to his mother, Latti headed back to the studio and recorded a plethora of music set to release this year.
